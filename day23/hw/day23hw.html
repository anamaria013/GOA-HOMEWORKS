<p style="color: aqua;">A squishy is a type of soft toy made of a specially formulated soft polyurethane foam, that slowly returns to its original shape after being squeezed. Squishies are manufactured into many different shapes and sizes, such as animals, fruits, and food items. They are often scented to match the object represented. The toy is also called kawaii squishy, kawaii meaning "cute" in Japanese.[1]

    Originating in Japan, squishies became available in the US in the spring of 2017. In the following years, the toys become popular all over the world, [1] and have huge presence on social media (especially YouTube and Instagram).[2]
    
    Squishies became popular among children and adolescents, but also among adults, for the tactile pleasure that one experiences squishing them â€” which is said to relieve stress.[2]
    
    In addition to relieving stress, squishies can also enhance focus and help regulate emotions by serving as a pleasant distraction. This makes it very useful for those who have anxiety or ADHD. [3]
